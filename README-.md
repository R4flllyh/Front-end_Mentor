## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [bootstrap.bundle.min.js](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap framework

### What I learned

here I learned about the use of cards from the bootstrap framework to generate QR codes, and how to implement them.

### Continued development

maybe I will continue to use this framework or I can switch and start learning the tailwind framework, because my senior classmate once said that tailwind is a flexible framework and can be edited as desired

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.freepik.com/freepik) - This helped me for finding background reference. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
